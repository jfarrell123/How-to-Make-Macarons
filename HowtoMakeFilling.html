  <h1>Making the Filling</h1>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>3 large egg whites</li>
    <li>1 cup of sugar</li>
    <li>1 cup (2 sticks) of unsalted butter, at room temperature, cut the butter into pieces</li>
    <li>Food coloring (optional)</li>
  <h2>First Step</h2>
  <p>In the bowl of an electric mixer, whisk the egg whites and sugar together.</p>
  <h2>Second Step</h2>
  <p>Next, set the mixer bowl over a saucepan of simmering water and heat the mixture, whisking often, until it feels very warm and the sugar has dissolved. This process should take 3 to 5 minutes.</p>
  <h2>Third Step</h2>
  <p>Transfer the heated bowl to back to the mixer, and fit with the whisk attachment. You also can use a standard whisk for this process. Whip on high speed until mixture is stiff and shiny. This should take 3 to 5 minutes.</p>
  <h2>Fourth Step</h2>
  <p>Add the butter into the mixer one pice at a time. Continue mixing until the butter is fully incorporated.</p>
  <h2>Fifth Step</h2>
  <p>Once you have completed all of the steps, your filling should be perfect. You can cover your filling and refridgerate it for up to one week. Make sure to bring the filling to room temperature before adding to the macarons.</p>
